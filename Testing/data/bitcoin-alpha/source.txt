This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin Alpha. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin Alpha rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research.

Data format
SOURCE, TARGET, RATING, TIME

    SOURCE: node id of source, i.e., rater
    TARGET: node id of target, i.e., ratee
    RATING: the source's rating for the target, ranging from -10 to +10 in steps of 1
    TIME: the time of the rating, measured as seconds since Epoch. (This can be converted to human readable data easily as described here)
